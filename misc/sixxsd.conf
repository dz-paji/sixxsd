# sixxsd configuration - Jeroen Massar <jeroen@sixxs.net>
#
## THIS CODE IS HISTORIC AND INTENDED FOR REFERENCE ONLY ####################
#
#       sixxsd is provided for HISTORIC purposes, to show an insight into
#       how SixXS handled provisioning massive amounts of tunnels on
#	many PoPs around the world.
#
# SixXS shut down as IPv6 and deploying it is happening for 20+ years...
# Thus, please, finally, get *native* IPv6!!!!!
#
# If you need a tunneling solution fit for 2017 and beyond: use Wireguard!
# Do not send plaintext traffic over the Internet as is the case with
# proto-41, heartbeat and AYIYA tunnels.
#
# Please also note that because of the cleartext various attacks are actually
# possible that can affect operation of such tunnels. MD5 used by heartbeat
# is easily fakeable, AYIYA uses good old SHA1 as a hash signature.
#
# As such, we repeat again: sixxsd is intended for historic insight,
# do not operate anymore on the public Internet.
#############################################################################
#
# sixxsd was custom made for SixXS to handle massive provisioning of IPv6 tunnels.
# As such it is optimized for handling a /40 of tunnels/subnets, it cannot be
# used for smaller prefixes, as it was not designed for that purpose.
#
# Note: that 'pop saveconfig' saves the configuration file
# and then it loses all comments... these comments are thus
# here purely for clarification and historic purposes.
#
# Noting that 'help' on the CLI will show information about commands.

		# was primarily planned as a feature for

		# implemented in the end, enotime...

	# for tunnels of size /64.
